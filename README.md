# Using Common Widgets
In this chapter, I learned how to use various Flutter widgets as the main tools for building user interfaces. I also learned that widgets like Scaffold, AppBar, SafeArea, Container, Text, RichText, Column, and Row serve as the key parts of a Flutter app.
The Scaffold widget sets up the basic layout for Material Design apps, making it simple to add features like app bars, floating action buttons, and snack bars. The AppBar takes this a step further by letting you customize the toolbar with options for the title, leading icons, actions, and even flexible space for other widgets like buttons or images. I learned that the SafeArea widget helps make sure that your content stays clear of notches and system elements, while the Container widget allows for various customizations, such as padding, margin, alignment, and transformation for its child widgets.
I also got to know the text widgets: Text, which is for showing standard text, and RichText, which is useful for mixing different styles within a single string. Plus, I looked into layout widgets, like Column and Row, which help arrange their child elements either vertically or horizontally. Finally, we touched on different button types like RaisedButton, FloatingActionButton, and IconButton, each serving its own purpose in the user interface. All these widgets work together to give us the ability to build responsive and friendly interfaces.
